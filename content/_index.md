<!-- This is Reiner Martin's personal website, totally and utterly under construction. -->

I am a mathematician and computer scientist by background, applying these skills to finance since 1995. I have both modelled and traded complex financial products for several investment banks based in London and New York, and held several leadership roles. Most recently, I have applied systematic investment strategies in asset management, and overseen a cooperation with a fintech to apply AI to investment strategies. Throughout my career I have always enjoyed teaching and passing on knowledge.

I am currently a lecturer, teaching finance, mathematics, and computer science.
