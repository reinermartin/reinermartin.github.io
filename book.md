# Review

“They constitute a systematic introduction to problems of great interest to practitioners and academic
researchers of option valuation, hedging and risk management.” “The presentation makes for easy reading
despite the difficulty of the subject.” ”… a remarkably well-presented introduction to stochastic calculus.”
