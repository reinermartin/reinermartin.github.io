# Paper ‘On the ideal structure of the Nevanlinna class’

I have published the content of my master thesis (done at Universität Karlsruhe in Germany) as:

Reiner Martin, On the ideal structure of the Nevanlinna class. Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 114, No. 1, 135-143 (1992). PDF

# Abstract

As quoted from the paper: “Let N denote the Nevanlinna class, i.e. the algebra of holomorphic functions of bounded characteristic in the open unit disc. We study analytic conditions for a finitely generated ideal to be equal to the whole algebra N. Then we characterize the finitely generated prime ideals containing a nontangential interpolating Blaschke product. Further, we give an example of an ideal of N whose closure in the natural metric on N is not an ideal.”
